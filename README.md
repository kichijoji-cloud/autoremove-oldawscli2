# Shell-Script for removing old version of AWS-CLI2


## Summary

Shell-Script for bash removed past versions remaining after AWS-CLI2 update, leaving the latest version.


----

### Objective

#### Solution


AWS-CLI2 is not provided in a package installer such as pip, so updating with the AWS-distributed installer consumes approximately 210 MB of storage for each version update.
This script keeps only the latest version of the AWS-CLI2 installation file and deletes the older version.

- As an example of the problems caused by AWSCLI2, 20 updates occurred over a two-month period from February 2023 to the end of March 2023, squeezing 8 GB of storage.
- If you have separate installations for the root user and for user privileges, storage is squeezed for the directory where the installation is made (20 updates over 2 months in the aforementioned example would consume 16GB for the two installations)
- If you have only 10GB to 20GB of storage in VPS, cloud instances, containers, etc., the system may become dysfunctional.

### Detail

| Software | Version | note |
| :----------- | :--------- | :--- |
| bash| 5.0.17|The environment I built is bash 5.0.17. I guess it will work with bash and zsh under version 5.0, but it is not guaranteed.|
